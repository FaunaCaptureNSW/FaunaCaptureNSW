# Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Wildlife Detection & Classification Tool

A set of tools for detecting and classifying animals in camera trap images.

## User Guide

Here is the [Comprehensive User Guide](./AWC135%20User%20Guide.pdf), including information on how to use this model effectively, its technical details and limitations, training data, a step-by-step guide (using Timelapse + AddaxAI), and FAQs.

A Timelapse template is provided [here](./timelapse_templates/) to get you started with Timelapse.

To run this model using Python, refer to the steps below.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

Make sure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed. I recommend using a Python environment management tool such as [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install)
- The `awc_helpers` package (To read more about this library, go [here](https://github.com/Australian-Wildlife-Conservancy-AWC/awc_inference)). Install via pip:
```bash
pip install awc-helpers
```
(To read more about this library, go [here](https://github.com/Australian-Wildlife-Conservancy-AWC/awc_inference))

- MegaDetector model (`.pt` file). You can view and download them [here](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/releases/tag/v1000.0) (v1000-redwood is one of the latest version)
- Our AWC species classifier model (`.pth` file). You can download it [here](https://github.com/Australian-Wildlife-Conservancy-AWC/awc-wildlife-classifier/releases/download/awc-135/awc-135-v1.pth)

### 2. Clone this repository

You can clone this repository by downloading it as a ZIP file (click on the green "<> Code" dropdown and select "Download ZIP").

Alternatively, you can run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Australian-Wildlife-Conservancy-AWC/awc-wildlife-classifier.git
```

Note that you'll need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/) first.

### 3. Configure

Edit `config.yaml` to set your model paths:

```yaml
detector_path: "models/<megadetector_weight>.pt"
classifier_path: "models/awc-135-v1.pth"
```

### 4. Run

Open a terminal/command prompt, change your directory to `awc-wildlife-classifier` (this is the repository you have just downloaded/cloned from step 2)

Then run:

```bash
python run_inference.py "<path_to_your_images>" --config config.yaml
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Windows
python run_inference.py "C:\CameraTrap\Photos" --config config.yaml

# Mac/Linux
python run_inference.py "/home/user/camera_trap_images" --config config.yaml
```

### 5. Results

The tool creates two output files (saved in your image folder, by default):
- `results.csv` - Spreadsheet-friendly format
- `results.json` - Timelapse-compatible JSON format

Plus a log file with timestamps for troubleshooting.

## Detailed Instructions

### Command-Line Options

```
python run_inference.py <image_folder> --config <config_file> [--output <output_name>]

Arguments:
  image_folder       Path to folder containing images (searches subfolders too)
  --config, -c       Path to YAML configuration file (required)
  --output, -o       Override output file name from config (optional)
```

### Configuration File

All settings are in `config.yaml`:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `detector_path` | Path to MegaDetector model | *required* |
| `classifier_path` | Path to species classifier | *required* |
| `label_path` | Path to labels text file | `labels.txt` |
| `output_name` | Name for output files. Can also be a full path | `results` |
| `detection_threshold` | Min confidence for detection (0-1) | `0.1` |
| `classification_threshold` | Min confidence for classification (0-1) | `0.5` |
| `topn` | Number of top predictions per animal | `1` |
| `classification_batch_size` | Crops processed at once (GPU memory) | `4` |
| `save_log` | Whether to save logs to a timestamped file | `false` |


## Troubleshooting

### "No images found"
- Check that your folder path is correct
- Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
- The tool searches subfolders automatically

### "Out of memory" error
- Reduce `classification_batch_size` in config (try 2 or 1)
- Set `force_cpu: true` to use CPU instead of GPU

### "File not found" errors
- Double-check all paths in `config.yaml`
- The script can recognize relative paths if the files/images are in the same directory as the python script. But if there's still errors, use full paths (e.g., `C:\Models\detector.pt`) instead

## Output Format

### CSV File

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Image Path | Full path to the source image |
| Bounding Box Confidence | Detection confidence (0-1) |
| Bounding Box Normalized | Box coordinates (x, y, width, height) |
| Label 1 | Top predicted species |
| Confidence 1 | Classification confidence |
| Label N... | Additional predictions if `topn > 1` |

### JSON File

Compatible with [Timelapse](http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/) image viewer software.
